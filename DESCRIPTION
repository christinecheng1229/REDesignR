Description: The main purpose of the tool is to help scientists determine
    the best restriction enzyme(s) to use for their sequence digestion
    experiment.  The tool will be an R package with a Shiny interface that
    simulates, optimizes and visualizes restriction enzyme digestion
    experiments.The tool automates optimal enzyme choice, provides
    intuitive visualization/interactive interfaces, and simulates
    multi-enzyme co-digestion experiments.
