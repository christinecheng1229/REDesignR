Description: The main purpose of the tool is to help scientists determine the 
  best restriction enzyme(s) to use for their sequence digestion experiment. 
  The tool will be an R package with a Shiny interface that simulates, optimizes
  and visualizes restriction enzyme digestion experiments.The tool automates
  optimal enzyme choice, provides intuitive visualization/interactive interfaces, 
  and simulates multi-enzyme co-digestion experiments.
