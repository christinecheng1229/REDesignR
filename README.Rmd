## Description
A paragraph that describes the purpose of the
package. Explain how your package add to or improve a current work
flow in bioinformatics or computational biology (i.e., how is it
unique?, what issue does it address?). Finally, include the R version
(not RStudio version) and platform (Mac, Windows, Linux (Debian,
Fedora/Redhat, Ubuntu)), used to develop the package. There should
be no Shiny implementation at this point.

The goal of REDesignR is to ...

## Installation

To install the latest version of the package:
``` r
<!-- # install.packages("pak") -->
<!-- pak::pak("christinecheng1229/REDesignR") -->
require("devtools")
<!-- install.packages("devtools") -->
<!-- library("devtools") -->
devtools::install github("christinecheng1229/REDesignR",build vignettes = TRUE)
library("REDesignR")
```

To run the shinyApp:

## Overview
Provide the following commands, customized to your R package.
Then provide an overview to briefly describe the main components of
the package. Include one image illustrating the overview of the
package, that shows the inputs and outputs. Ensure the image is
deposited in the correct location, as discussed in class. Point the user
to vignettes for a tutorial of your package.
``` r
ls("package:REDesignR")
data(package = "REDesignR") # optional
browseVignettes("REDesignR")
```
`REDesignR` contains # functions.

1.  ***Function1*** for calculating ...

2.  ***Function2*** for calculating ... 

3.  ***Function3*** for plotting ... 

The package also contains __ datasets, called __ and __ Refer to package vignettes for more details. An overview of the package is illustrated below.

## Contributions
Provide a note clearly indicating contributions from you and
contributions from other packages/sources for each function.
Remember your individual contributions to the package are important.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(REDesignR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
